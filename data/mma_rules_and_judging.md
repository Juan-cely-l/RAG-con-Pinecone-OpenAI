# MMA Rules and Judging (Sample Reference)

This file summarizes basic MMA judging concepts for a course RAG demo. It is not an official rulebook.

## Round structure

- Most professional MMA fights are 3 rounds of 5 minutes each.
- Main events and title fights are often 5 rounds of 5 minutes each.
- There is usually a 1-minute rest period between rounds.

## 10-point must system

- Judges score each round independently.
- The winner of the round typically receives 10 points.
- The other fighter usually receives 9 points, or fewer in more dominant rounds.

## Primary judging criteria

Judges primarily evaluate:

1. Effective striking
2. Effective grappling

If those are relatively even, judges may consider:

1. Effective aggression
2. Fighting area control (often called octagon or cage control)

## Common ways a fight can end

- Decision (unanimous, split, majority)
- Knockout (KO)
- Technical knockout (TKO)
- Submission
- Doctor stoppage
- Disqualification

## Important practical note

A fighter moving forward is not automatically winning the round. Judges are expected to prioritize effective offense and impact over simple forward pressure when the rules are applied correctly.
